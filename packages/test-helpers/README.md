# @secrez/test-helpers

Secrez is the secrets manager for the cryptocurrencies era.

This is a utils library for testing.

## History

**2.0.0**

- Use reduced versions of other Secrez packages to avoid cyclic dependencies. They didn't affect any Secrez package in production because test-helpers is used only for testing purposes, but it is cleaner this way.
